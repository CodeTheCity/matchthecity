With careful consideration of the needs and wants of the valued skaters, BMXers and inliners and a generous sum of £120,000 funding from Aberdeen Forward we are thrilled to announce a brand new design coming to you! The park will be closed for six weeks from Monday 26th of January, 2015 and is scheduled to re-open on Saturday 7th of March, 2015  giving us the opportunity to bring the North East of Scotland an ambitious state of the art revamped Skatepark.</p><p>All other venue facilities are still open during this period.</p>"}]
